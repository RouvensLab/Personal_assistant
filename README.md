Personal Assistant - Flashcard Program
Introduction
This project aims to develop a comprehensive personal assistant that not only helps users learn new information but also adapts to their existing knowledge. The primary goal is to create an efficient learning tool that focuses on teaching users only what they don't already know, saving valuable time.

Features
1. The current version of the program offers the following features:

2. Flashcards: Users can create flashcards and learn from them. This feature allows for interactive and engaging learning experiences.

3. Search Engine: The program includes a search engine that enables users to search for specific words or topics within the entire dataset. This functionality helps users quickly find relevant information.

4. Well-Organized Data: All the data is stored in a designated folder and organized in a structured manner. The program follows a subject-based approach, allowing users to access subjects such as French, English, German, Chemistry, and Biology. Users can access these folders directly from the main program or even explore them as CSV data files using a file explorer. This makes the data easily accessible to the user without relying solely on the program.

Installation
To install and run the program, please follow these steps:

1. Install the project files onto your local machine.

2. Set up a development environment with the required libraries listed in the requirements. You can also choose to automate this process.
